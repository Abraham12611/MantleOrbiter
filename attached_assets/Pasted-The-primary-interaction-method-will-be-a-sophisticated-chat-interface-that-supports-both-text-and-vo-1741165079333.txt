The primary interaction method will be a sophisticated chat interface that supports both text and voice inputs. The voice recognition system will be optimized for blockchain terminology and Mantle-specific terms. As users engage with the AI, contextually relevant visual elements will animate and highlight, creating an intuitive connection between conversation and visual representation.

The knowledge explorer section will feature beautifully designed cards representing different protocols, services, and concepts within the Mantle ecosystem. Each card will expand into a comprehensive guide with interactive demonstrations, video tutorials, and simplified explanations. The personalized recommendation engine will highlight opportunities relevant to the user's profile, with clear visual indicators for potential benefits and risks.

For users seeking guided experiences, the application will offer interactive tours through various Mantle protocols, with step-by-step tutorials that combine explanatory text, visual cues, and practice simulations. The interface will implement smooth transitions between sections with subtle animations that enhance comprehension without becoming distracting.
